# Manticore

## About the project

Manticore is a work-in-progress implementation of the Open Compute Project's
[Cerberus] attestation protocol, developed as part of the [OpenTitan project].

Manticore aims to eventually achieve parity with Microsoft's C implementation,
while also being a proving ground for improvements and enhancements of the
protocol.

## Using `manticore`

Manticore's API is still unstable, and not at the point where it can be safely
released onto `crates.io`. For now, use a git dependency instead:
```
manticore = { git = "https://git@github.com:lowRISC/manticore.git" }
```
We reserve the right to break any code that depends on the bleeding edge.
