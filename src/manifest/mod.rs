//! Cerberus manifest manipulation.
//!
//! Cerberus uses a number of signed "manifests" to describe both the physical
//! configuration of a system it protects, and to describe policies on what
//! firmware can run on those systems.
//!
//! # Wire Format
//!
//! On the wire (and in flash) every manifest has the following layout,
//! expressed as a pseudo-Rust struct. Integers are encoded in little-endian
//! order, and `_` indicates reserved fields or padding that should be set
//! to 0.
//! ```ignore
//! struct Manifest {
//!     // Overall header.
//!     total_len: u16,
//!     manifest_type: u16, // See `ManifestType`.
//!     version_id: u32,
//!     signature_len: u16,
//!     signature_type: u8,
//!     _: u8,
//!
//!     // Table-of-contents.
//!     entry_count: u8,
//!     hash_count: u8,
//!     hash_type: u8,
//!     _: u8,
//!     toc: [TocEntry; self.entry_count],
//!     hashes: [Hash<hash_type>; self.hash_count + 1],
//!
//!     body: [u8],
//!
//!     signature: [u8; self.signature_len],
//! }
//!
//! struct TocEntry {
//!     element_type: u8, // See `Manifest::ElementType`.
//!     parent: u8,
//!     format_version: u8,
//!     hash_id: u8,
//!     offset: u16,
//!     length: u16,
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! Each manifest consists of a number of "elements", whose format is
//! manifest-specific. The "table of contents" defines these elements; each
//! entry includes:
//! - The offset and length within the manifest corresponding to it.
//! - The encoding, given by the type and the format version.
//! - An optional parent index, referring to another element in the TOC
//!   (no parent indicated by `0xff`).
//! - An optional hash index, referring to a hash in the TOC's hash list.
//!   (Again, no hash indicated by `0xff`).
//!
//! The final hash in the list of hashes is a hash of the whole TOC.
//! For more information on how to interact with the `TOC`, see
//! the [`Toc`](struct.Toc.html) type.
//!
//! # Parsing and Encoding APIs
//!
//! The `manticore::manifest` module provides an API for reading a manifest
//! stored in remote flash with minimal memory overhead, allowing the caller
//! to specify which arena various book-keeping information should be allocated
//! in. The [`Container`] type is the entry-point for this functionality.
//!
//! This module also provides an "owned" API that eagerly parses the manifest
//! into a tree based on his TOC. This requires the `std` feature, and is intended
//! for use by tooling. The [`owned::Container`] type is the relevant entry
//! point.
