//! Networking interfaces.
//!
//! This module provides generic, abstract networking interfaces for sending
//! buffers over a "network". The term "network" is used very loosely: for
//! our purposes, a network is an object upon which we can transact encoded
//! buffers along with the bits necessary to encode a Cerberus header.
//!
//! For example, if an integration wished to receive requests from a "host"
//! device over a SPI line, it should tie up all the necessary implementation
//! details into a [`HostPort`] implementation.
